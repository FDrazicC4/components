# Getting Started

Brewkit components are built on top of Material-UI with a focus on improving developer experience without disrupting
the things people may like about the underlying framework. By default, Brewkit provides no additional theming beyond
what is provided by Material-UI. Instead, we use themes, comprised of basic BEM and static CSS files to provide specific
styles to the components. This allows us to simplify the process of implementing themes and makes it easier for you to
create your own in whatever way you like.

<br />

## 1. Installing Brewkit

To install and save in your package.json dependencies, in your terminal, run:

```js
// npm
npm i @brewkit/components

// with yarn
yarn add @brewkit/components
```

<br />

## 2. Adding `<BrewkitProvider />`

In order to ensure components behave correctly and styles don't fight for specificity, your application should be
wrapped with the `<BrewkitProvider />` component.

```tsx

// index.tsx

import * as React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import BrewkitProvider from '@brewkit/components/BrewkitProvider';


const AppRoot = React.lazy(() => import('@scenes/App'));


render(
    <BrewkitProvider>
        <React.Suspense fallback={null}>
            <AppRoot />
        </React.Suspense>
    </BrewkitProvider>,
    document.getElementById('root'),
);

```

<br />

## 3. Adding a Theme

Themes are separately maintained and distributed within the `@brewkit/themes` package.

```js
// npm
npm i @brewkit/themes

// with yarn
yarn add @brewkit/themes
```

You can then import the desired theme's .css file into your app.

```tsx
// AppRoot.tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import Splash from '@scenes/Splash';
import '@brewkit/themes/cerveza.css';


function AppRoot(): React.ReactElement {
    return (
        <Splash />
    );
}


export default AppRoot;
```

<br />

## 4. Brewkit Components

Brewkit components can be imported and accessed from `@brewkit/components`.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@brewkit/components';


export const MyScene = (): React.ReactElement => {

    // ...component stuff

    return (
        <div>
            <Button />
        </div>
    );

});


export default MyScene;

```

<br />

## Material-UI Components

The entirety of `@material-ui/core` has been made available via the `Mui` component within Brewkit, however we recommend
you only use these when Brewkit provides no other alternatives.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Mui } from '@brewkit/components';


export const MyScene = (): React.ReactElement => {

    // ...component stuff

    return (
        <div>
            <Mui.Button />
        </div>
    );

});


export default MyScene;

```
