# Getting Started

Brewkit components are built on top of Material-UI with a focus on improving developer experience without disrupting
the things people may like about the underlying framework. By default, Brewkit provides no additional theming beyond
what is provided by Material-UI. Instead, we use themes, comprised of basic BEM and static CSS files to provide specific
styles to the components. This allows us to simplify the process of implementing themes and makes it easier for you to
create your own in whatever way you like.

<br />

## Installing Brewkit

To install and save in your package.json dependencies, in your terminal, run:

```js
// npm
npm i @brewkit/components

// with yarn
yarn add @brewkit/components
```

<br />

## Adding a Theme

As mentioned above, themes are not directly a part of Brewkit. Instead, they are separately maintained and distributed.
You can find some existing themes [here](https://github.com/brewkit/components/blob/master/theme/cerveza/dist/index.css).

Most themes can be added to your project by simply pulling the CSS file into your `index.html`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="my-brewkit-theme.css">
</head>
<body>

    <div id="root"></div>

</body>
</html>
```

<br />

## Brewkit Components

Brewkit components can be imported and accessed from `@brewkit/components`.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@brewkit/components';


export const MyScene = (): React.ReactElement => {

    // ...component stuff

    return (
        <div>
            <Button />
        </div>
    );

});


export default MyScene;

```

<br />

## Material-UI Components

The entirety of `@material-ui/core` has been made available via the `Mui` component within Brewkit, however we recommend
you only use these when Brewkit provides no other alternatives.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Mui } from '@brewkit/components';


export const MyScene = (): React.ReactElement => {

    // ...component stuff

    return (
        <div>
            <Mui.Button />
        </div>
    );

});


export default MyScene;

```
