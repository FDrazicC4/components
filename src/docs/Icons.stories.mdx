# Icons

Material-UI, and Brewkit as a result, provides icons support in three ways:

1. Standardized Material Design icons exported as React components (SVG icons).
2. With the SvgIcon component, a React wrapper for custom SVG icons.
3. With the Icon component, a React wrapper for custom font icons.

The primary and suggested way is to use `@material-ui/icons` library included alongside Brewkit. The full list of icons
available can be found [here](https://material-ui.com/components/material-icons/).

## Usage

Import icons using:

<Source code="import { AccessAlarm, ThreeDRotation } from '@material-ui/icons';" />

Each icon also has a "theme": Filled (default), Outlined, Rounded, Two tone and Sharp. If you want to import the icon
component with a theme other than default, append the theme name to the icon name. For example, with the `Delete` icon:

- Filled theme (default) - `import { Delete } from '@material-ui/icons';`,
- Outlined theme  - `import { DeleteOutlined } from '@material-ui/icons';`,
- Rounded theme  - `import { DeleteRounded } from '@material-ui/icons';`,
- Twotone theme  - `import { DeleteTwoTone } from '@material-ui/icons';`,
- Sharp theme  - `import { DeleteSharp } from '@material-ui/icons';`.

> Note: The Material Design specification names the icons using "snake_case" naming (for example delete_forever,
> add_a_photo), while `@material-ui/icons` exports the respective icons using "PascalCase" naming (for example
> DeleteForever, AddAPhoto). There are three exceptions to this naming rule: 3d_rotation exported as ThreeDRotation, 4k
> exported as FourK, and 360 exported as ThreeSixty.
