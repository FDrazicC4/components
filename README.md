## Description

Brewkit components are raw and contain no additional styling. Instead, they provide prebuilt functionality, built-in support
for FLIP animations, and an abundance of classes that you can style however you see fit.

Brewkit is designed to be themed and support separately distributed CSS files that can be used in your project or as the basis for your own theme.

> If starting your project from scratch, we highly recommend you use [@brewkit/create](https://github.com/brewkit/create).
